## 1. Scala Features

Some of the features of Scala that you might have seen so far are:
- Type Inference
- Immutability (val vs var & immutable collections)
- String Formatting
- Last Line of Function is Result
- Expression Functions
- Etc...

Some that you might have not seen (in detail) yet are:
- [Tuples](https://www.scala-exercises.org/std_lib/tuples)
- Objects
- Case Classes
- Traits and [Algebraic Data Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type)
- Pattern Matching
- Functions as First Class Citizens
- Operator Overloading
- Ranges
- Non-strictness (Lazy Evaluation)

Which we'll dive into these today. Exercises can be found in the `src/main/scala/learninghours/partone` folder.
