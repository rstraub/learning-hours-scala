Some of the features of Scala that you might have seen so far are:

- Immutability (val vs var & immutable collections)

Some that you might have not seen yet are:
- Tuples
- Traits and Algebraic Data Types
- Pattern Matching
- Functions as First Class Citizens
- Operator Overloading
- Ranges

Which we'll dive into these today. Exercises can be found in the `src/main/scala/learninghours/partone` folder.
