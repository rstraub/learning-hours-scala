# Part Two - Error Handling (the functional way)

This time we'll dive into error handling in Scala, and FP in general. We'll look at the following topics:

1. Referential Transparency, Exceptions & Side Effects (ReferentialTransparencySpec)
2. Sentinel Values (SentinelValuesSpec)
3. Try (TrySpec)
4. Option (OptionSpec)
5. Either (EitherSpec)
6. Validated (ValidatedSpec)
