# Part One - Scala Features

Loosely uses https://www.scala-exercises.org/std_lib as inspiration, have a look if you want to learn more about Scala.

Some of the features of Scala that you might have seen so far are:
- Type Inference
- Immutability (val vs var & immutable collections)
- String Formatting
- Last Line of Function is Result
- Expression Functions
- Etc...

Some that you might have not seen (in detail) yet are:
- Tuples
- Objects and Companion Objects
- Case Classes
- Traits and [Algebraic Data Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type)
- Pattern Matching
- Functions as First Class Citizens
- For comprehensions

Which we'll dive into today. Exercises can be found in the `src/main/scala/learninghours/partone` folder.

If we have time, we'll also look at:
- Operator Overloading
- Ranges
- Non-strictness (Lazy Evaluation)
  Otherwise, we'll tackle them later
